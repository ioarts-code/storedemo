## GraphQL Queries

The app makes these GraphQL queries to fetch data:

**GET_PRODUCTS**
```graphql
query GetProducts {
  products(first: 100) {
    id
    name
    slug
    description
    price
    categories {
      id
      name
      slug
    }
    images {
      id
      url
      fileName
    }
  }
}
```

**GET_PRODUCTS_BY_CATEGORY**
```graphql
query GetProductsByCategory($categoryId: ID!) {
  products(first: 100, where: { categories_some: { id: $categoryId } }) {
    id
    name
    slug
    description
    price
    categories {
      id
      name
      slug
    }
    images {
      id
      url
      fileName
    }
  }
}
```

**SEARCH_PRODUCTS**
```graphql
query SearchProducts($search: String!) {
  products(first: 100, where: { name_contains: $search }) {
    id
    name
    slug
    description
    price
    categories {
      id
      name
      slug
    }
    images {
      id
      url
      fileName
    }
  }
}
```
